### 1. Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### 2.Project Motivation

  This is an Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project for Write a Data Science Blog. I picked 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and
  results dataset from Kaggle. This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions about how the Olympics have evolved over time, 
  including questions about the participation and performance of women/men, nations, as well as different sports and events per season. 
  
   My key interests would be:
   
   * How many women and men have been participating in the Olympic Games and their Age Distribution? How is the participation per edition of
   the Games?
   * How is the Relationship/Distribution between Height and Weight for Female and Male Athletes? 
   * How many athletes had participated in the Games? Top 10 Countries with the highest number of Athletes competing?
   * How is the Gold Medal winner distribution? per country? per Sport? and Age?

  This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. As sides note that the
  winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four
  year cycle starting with 1994, then summer in 1996, then winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data
  is to assume that the summer and Winter Games have always been staggered. 
  
### 3. File Descriptions 

  The data can be found in the file athlete_events.zip contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). The columns are:

  * ID - Unique number for each athlete
  * Name - Athlete's name
  * Sex - M or F
  * Age - Integer
  * Height - In centimeters
  * Weight - In kilograms
  * Team - Team name
  * NOC - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
  * Games - Year and season
  * Year - Integer
  * Season - Summer or Winter
  * City - Host city
  * Sport - Sport
  * Event - Event
  * Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

  The Olympic data on www.sports-reference.com is the result of an incredible amount of research by a group of Olympic history
  enthusiasts and self-proclaimed 'statistorians'. Check out their blog for more information. All done was consolidated their decades
  of work into a convenient format for data analysis. Credit to Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree and Kaggle for the data. The licensing
